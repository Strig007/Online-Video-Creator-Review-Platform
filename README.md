# Online-Video-Creator-Review-Platform

This website allows users to add and/or review creators from various platforms such as YouTube and Twitch. The purpose of this project is to have a place where community members can share and review their favorite creators. Given the demand of online video especially videos made by individuals, there needs to be a website that has some information on creators that is easy to find and not dependent on a singular platform (E.g.: Only YouTube). IMDB was the first inspiration for this project, it is a database of movies, TV series as well as actors and people involved in production. It also displays ratings for each movie in its database. As for the reviews and favourites feature of this project, it was inspired by myanimelist.net and its user discussion and review threads on series
